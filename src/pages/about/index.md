### Gigleer

##### Our mission

In an uncertain world that we live in today due to covid-19 and where 25% of Gen-Z are unemployed we want to make a difference. We want to give Gen-Z a real chance for them to get into the job sector, get indepence, live their own life and reach their own goals and dreams. That is why we built Gigleer.

With Gigleer we connect employees and Gigleers with "on the go work" and a learning platform.
